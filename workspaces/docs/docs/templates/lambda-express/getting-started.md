Note that your API will not work yet. It first needs to be deployed as per instructions below.

You should now be able to access your API. The domain under which the API is deployed is configured in `goldstack.json` under `"deployments[*].apiDomain"`. You can access this API domain with a browser since the default API provided in the template allows for GET requests to the root.

### Development

The source code for the express server is defined in the `src/` folder. The entry point for defining new routes is in `src/server.ts`. The easiest way to get started extending the API is to modify or add new routes to the server here.
