## Notes

### Max ListenersExceededWarning on `compile-watch` command

When running the `compile-watch` command in the root, you may get the following warning:

```
(node:97874) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 SIGINT listeners added to [process]. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit
```

This is nothing to worry about. It is caused by the command spawning a lot of sub-processes, since an individual `nodemon` process is started for every package that is watched (see also [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9768444/possible-eventemitter-memory-leak-detected) on Stackoverflow).
