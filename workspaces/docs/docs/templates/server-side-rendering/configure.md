The following key properties need to be configured for this template:

- **Lambda Name Prefix**: The prefix to be used by [Lambda names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_CreateFunction.html#SSS-CreateFunction-request-FunctionName) generated by this template for the defined routes.
- **Domain**: The domain where the website should be deployed to. For instance, to publish the website to `https://mydomain.com/` the domain `mydomain.com` needs to be configured.
- **Hosted Zone Domain**: A Route 53 hosted zone that will allow adding the _Domain_ as a record. For instance, in order to configure the domain `mydomain.com`, the hosted zone `mydomain.com` would be valid. For more details, please check [Hosted Zone Configuration](https://docs.goldstack.party/docs/goldstack/configuration#hosted-zone-configuration) in the Goldstack documentation.
