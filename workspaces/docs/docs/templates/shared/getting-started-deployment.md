### 3. Deploy Application

Once the infrastructure is successfully set up in AWS using `yarn infra up`, we can deploy the module. For this, simply run the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy [deploymentName]
```

This will either be `yarn deploy dev` or `yarn deploy prod` depending on your choice of deployment during project configuration.
