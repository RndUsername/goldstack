# Goldstack DynamoDB CLI Template Tools

This library provides a CLI for building Node.js modules that wrap a DynamoDB Table. These tools allow deploying the infrastructure for the table as well as a way to connect with the table across multiple environments (such as dev, staging and production).

For more information, see [DynamoDB Template](https://docs.goldstack.party/docs/templates/dynamodb).
