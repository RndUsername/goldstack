# Goldstack Terraform AWS Utilities

This library allows configuring Terraform dynamically from Node.js in order to support deployments to AWS.

See [source code](https://github.com/goldstack/goldstack/blob/master/workspaces/templates-lib/packages/utils-terraform-aws/src/utilsTerraformAws.ts).

This library is used to support Goldstack templates that define AWS infrastructure such as [Next.js + Bootstrap](https://goldstack.party/templates/nextjs-bootstrap).
