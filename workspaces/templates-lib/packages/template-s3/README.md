# Goldstack S3 Template Tools

This library provides an API and CLI for building Node.js modules that wrap an S3 bucket. These tools allow deploying the infrastructure for the bucket as well as a way to connect with the bucket across multiple environments (such as dev, staging and production).

For more information, see [S3 Template](https://docs.goldstack.party/docs/templates/s3).
